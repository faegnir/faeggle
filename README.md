Made a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
This website has three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

On the Google Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

On the Google Image Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options).

I've tried to match my website's aesthetic to Google's own aesthetic as much as possible. Used css and html on process.
